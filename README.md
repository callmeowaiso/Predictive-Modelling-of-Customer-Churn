# Predictive Modelling of Customer Churn in the Telecom Sector Using Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**. Key features of the project:

- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Uses **SMOTE** to ensure fairer model training and better performance on minority classes.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand churn patterns.  
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Encoding:** Prepare data for model training.  
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Uses accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized via GridSearchCV for both classifiers.  
- **Model Interpretability:** Focus on feature importance analysis.  

This workflow ensures robust churn prediction and highlights the impact of bala
